## How it works

A 12 bit dac

## How to test

Plug in pins to esp32-wroom-s3 controller with GPIO 1-3 for clk, rst-n, and ena respectively. GPIO 11-4 for the rightmost ui-in bits and 12-15 fro the 4 leftmost bits of ui-in. Test by seeing the DAC can replicate values 1024, 2048, and 4095 on a wave analyzer or serial output of the esp32-wroom-s3.

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
