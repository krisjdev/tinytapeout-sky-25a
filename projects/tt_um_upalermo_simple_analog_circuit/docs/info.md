## How it works

This is a simple NMOS current mirror. The idea is to go through the entire flow up to submission (xschem schematic entry and simulation with ngspice, familiarize ourselves with the SKY130 process & pdk, magic, drc/lvs, github, etc.); in preparation for hopefully more interesting circuits on future tapeouts.

## How to test

Apply a voltage to the output and measure current. Sweep voltage and plot current (IV curve).
