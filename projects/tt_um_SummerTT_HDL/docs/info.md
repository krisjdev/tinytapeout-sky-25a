# Game Of Life - (John Conway) remake on ASIC
## How it works
The registers are randomized, and then the algorithm for the game of like is run.

Oxman, G., Weiss, S. and Beâ€™ery, Y., 2014. Computational methods for Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton. Journal of Computational Science, 5(1), pp.24-31.

## How to test

Once the ASIC is powered, it should automatically turn on and generate cellular automata patterns according to the Game of Life's rules. by inputting a high signal to port 0 it stops the simulation where it was, and inputting a high signal to port 1 it will randomize the game.

## External hardware

a  [Tiny Tapeout VGA Pmod](https://store.tinytapeout.com/products/TinyVGA-Pmod-p678647356). and possibly buttons or switches im unsure for port 0 and 1
