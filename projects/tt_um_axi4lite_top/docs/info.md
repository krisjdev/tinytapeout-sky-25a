##  Overview
This project implements a **self-contained AXI4-Lite system** with a master and a slave connected inside a top-level wrapper (`axi4lite_top`).  
It exposes a **simple control interface** so that reads and writes can be performed without directly driving AXI signals.  

---

##  How It Works
- The **top module** (`axi4lite_top`) instantiates:
  - An **AXI4-Lite Master**  
  - An **AXI4-Lite Slave**  
- Instead of requiring the user to control all AXI signals, the top module provides a simplified interface:
  - `ui_in[0]` → Start Write  
  - `ui_in[2:1]` → Write Address  
  - `uio_in` → Write Data  
  - `ui_in[4]` → Start Read  
  - `ui_in[3:2]` → Read Address  
- When a transaction is started:
  - The master drives the appropriate AXI4-Lite signals.  
  - The slave responds according to AXI protocol.  
  - When the transaction finishes, `uo_out[0]` goes high (Done).  
  - On reads, the data is returned via `uio_out`.  

Effectively, this module **hides AXI4-Lite complexity** and lets the user test simple memory-mapped transactions.

##  How to Test
Two types of testbenches are provided:

### 1. Verilog Testbench
- Located at `sim/axi4lite_tb.v`.  
- Runs a reset → write → read → check sequence.  
- Displays results in the simulator console.

### 2. Cocotb Testbench
- Located at `sim/test_axi4lite.py`.  
- Uses Python for more flexible verification.  
- Run with Icarus Verilog:
  ```bash
  make SIM=icarus TOPLEVEL=axi4lite_top MODULE=test_axi4lite
