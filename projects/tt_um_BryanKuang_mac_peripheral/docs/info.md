## How it works

This project is an 8×8→16‑bit Multiply–Accumulate (MAC) peripheral designed for the TinyTapeout platform. It is ideal for DSP applications or any design requiring efficient, repeated multiplication and addition.

To fit within the limited I/O of TinyTapeout, the MAC core uses a **2‑cycle 8‑bit serial interface**. This allows two 8-bit operands to be sent to the core and a full 16‑bit result to be read back, all through a standard 8-bit data bus. The module also supports configurable signed/unsigned arithmetic and provides overflow detection.

### Key Features

- **Compact MAC Core**: Provides a full 8x8 MAC unit with a 17-bit accumulator and overflow detection.
- **2-Cycle Serial Interface**: A simple 2‑cycle input/output protocol allows full 16-bit operations using only 8-bit data ports, making it easy to integrate with microcontrollers or other hosts.
- **Signed/Unsigned Support**: A dedicated control pin (`signed_mode`) allows switching between signed and unsigned arithmetic.
- **High-Speed Operation**: Maintains full 50 MHz operation with a deterministic 4‑cycle pipeline latency.

### Architecture

The peripheral's architecture is a 4-stage pipeline designed for stable, high-speed operation:

1. **Input Stage & Serial Interface**: Captures and assembles the two 8‑bit operands and control signals over two clock cycles. A change detector triggers the pipeline only when new, stable data is available.
2. **Pipeline Register Stage**: Registers the inputs for timing closure and passes the `signed_mode` setting to the multiplier and accumulator.
3. **Multiplier Stage**: A configurable 8×8 block that produces a 16‑bit product, supporting both signed and unsigned modes.
4. **Accumulator Stage**: A 17‑bit adder with `clear_and_mult` control. It accumulates results and sets an overflow flag if the result exceeds the 16-bit range.

## Pinout

| Pin           | Direction | Function                                                                    |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ui_in[7:0]`  | Input     | 8-bit Data Bus. Used for Data A (cycle 1) and Data B (cycle 2).             |
| `uio_in[0]`   | Input     | `clear_and_mult` (0 = accumulate, 1 = clear before multiplying)             |
| `uio_in[1]`   | Input     | `enable` (Must be high during the 2-cycle input phase)                      |
| `uio_in[2]`   | Input     | `signed_mode` (0 = unsigned, 1 = signed)                                    |
| `uo_out[7:0]` | Output    | 8-bit Data Bus. Cycles between the high and low bytes of the 16-bit result. |
| `uio_out[0]`  | Output    | `overflow` flag (High when an arithmetic overflow occurs)                   |
| `uio_out[1]`  | Output    | `data_ready` flag (High when a new result is available)                     |

## How to Use the MAC

Operating the MAC involves sending two 8-bit operands and control signals over two clock cycles, waiting for the pipeline to process, and then reading the 16-bit result over two subsequent cycles.

### Data Transmission Protocol

**Input Protocol (2 cycles):**

- **Cycle 1**:
  - Place 8-bit **Data A** on `ui_in[7:0]`.
  - Set `uio_in[1]` to `1` to **enable** the interface.
  - Set `uio_in[0]` (`clear_and_mult`) and `uio_in[2]` (`signed_mode`) as needed. These values are only captured on the first cycle.
- **Cycle 2**:
  - Place 8-bit **Data B** on `ui_in[7:0]`.
  - Keep `uio_in[1]` (`enable`) at `1`.
- After Cycle 2, set `uio_in[1]` (`enable`) to `0` to complete the input operation.

**Output Protocol (2 cycles):**

- After an operation is complete (approx. 4-6 cycles), the `data_ready` flag (`uio_out[1]`) will go high.
- The 16-bit result is available on `uo_out[7:0]` and cycles between the high and low bytes on every clock edge.
- **Read Cycle 1**: Capture the **High Byte** (bits 15:8) of the result.
- **Read Cycle 2**: Capture the **Low Byte** (bits 7:0) of the result.
- The `overflow` flag is available on `uio_out[0]`.

### Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Multiplication (`5 * 6`)

```
// 1. Send data to calculate 5 * 6 = 30
// Cycle 1: Send Data A (5) and control signals (clear=1, signed=0)
ui_in <= 8'h05;
uio_in <= 3'b011; // {signed_mode, enable, clear_and_mult}

// Cycle 2: Send Data B (6)
ui_in <= 8'h06;
uio_in <= 3'b010; // {signed_mode, enable, clear_and_mult} - only enable matters

// 2. Wait ~4-6 cycles for the pipeline.

// 3. Read the result (30 = 0x001E)
// Read Cycle 1: uo_out will be 0x00 (High Byte)
// Read Cycle 2: uo_out will be 0x1E (Low Byte)
```

#### Example 2: Accumulation (`100 + 25`)

```
// 1. First, calculate 10 * 10 = 100 with clear_and_mult = 1
// ... send 10 and 10 ...

// 2. Wait for the operation to complete.

// 3. Next, calculate 5 * 5 = 25 with clear_and_mult = 0 to accumulate
// Cycle 1: Send Data A (5) and control signals (clear=0, signed=0)
ui_in <= 8'h05;
uio_in <= 3'b010; // {signed_mode, enable, clear_and_mult}

// Cycle 2: Send Data B (5)
ui_in <= 8'h05;
uio_in <= 3'b010;

// 4. Wait for the pipeline.

// 5. Read the result (125 = 0x007D)
// Read Cycle 1: uo_out will be 0x00 (High Byte)
// Read Cycle 2: uo_out will be 0x7D (Low Byte)
```

#### Example 3: Signed Multiplication (`10 * -5`)

```
// 1. Send data for 10 * -5 = -50, with signed_mode = 1
//    -5 in 8-bit two's complement is 0xFB (251)
// Cycle 1: Send Data A (10) and control signals (clear=1, signed=1)
ui_in <= 8'h0A;
uio_in <= 3'b111; // {signed_mode, enable, clear_and_mult}

// Cycle 2: Send Data B (251)
ui_in <= 8'hFB;
uio_in <= 3'b110;

// 2. Wait for the pipeline.

// 3. Read the result (-50 = 0xFFCE in 16-bit two's complement)
// Read Cycle 1: uo_out will be 0xFF (High Byte)
// Read Cycle 2: uo_out will be 0xCE (Low Byte)
```

## External hardware

No external hardware is required. This is a purely digital design that operates with:

- **Clock**: A 50MHz system clock from the TinyTapeout board.
- **Reset**: An active-low reset signal.
- **Digital I/O**: The standard TinyTapeout pin interface for sending operands and control signals.
