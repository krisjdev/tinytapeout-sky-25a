## How it works

This is basically a 12 hour clock (that displays minutes and hours) with an AM/PM indicator. This works by incrementing in seconds (which is not an output) and checking when to turn over the minute/hour.

## How to test

To test, you have to have a clock signal, reset signal, and ena signal going in where ena is pulsing every second. These signals are ui_in[7:5] so they are manually going in so that there is more flexibility.

## External hardware

There isn't any notable external hardware unless you want to connect it to an LED display to see the time/output.
