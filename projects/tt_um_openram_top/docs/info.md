## How it works

A simple design with a 16x32 OpenRAM generated 1rw macro using two phased clocking to avoid potential hold violations.

Supports clocks up to 250Mhz

## How to test

assign web = ui_in[6]; //
assign csb = ui_in[5]; // chip select
assign sclkb = ui_in[4]; // phased clock b
assign sclka = ui_in[3]; // phased clock a
assign scan_mode = ui_in[2]; //1 scan reg chain, 0 scan phase chain
assign scan_enable = ui_in[1]; //scan chain enable
assign scan_in = ui_in[0]; //input value

uio_in[3:0] are for byte write masking
