# Stochastic add and multiply dual signal encoding
## How it works

The data is converted from binary-weighted to a serial probability code data stream with two signals, allowing negative numbers to be processed by a stochastic computer.  Then multiple and add operations are computed and converted back into a serial binary weighted stream.

## How to test

Input two serial binary weighted serial streams in 2-complement format. Begin reading the data when the serial clock signal goes high.  

## External hardware

ADALM2000 and Python to set up the serial data stream and to analyze the data coming out.
