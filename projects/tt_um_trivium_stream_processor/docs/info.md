## How it works

This design implements *Trivium-lite*, a minimalistic variant of the Trivium stream coder using three 64-bit shift registers (`s1`, `s2`, `s3`) as internal state. The coder produces a keystream by iteratively updating these registers with a custom linear feedback shift register (LFSR) logic and XORing the output with the plaintext.

---

## Internal State

- `s1`, `s2`, `s3`: 64-bit registers acting as LFSRs.
- `temp_keystream`: 8-bit buffer to collect keystream bits.
- `step`: 3-bit counter to track cycles (0–7 per byte).
- FSM states: `IDLE`, `RUN`, `RESET`.

---

## Process Overview

1. **Seeding Phase (IDLE)**  
   When `uio_in` is a valid 8-bit seed (≠ 0x00, ≠ 0xFF), the FSM transitions to `RUN`. The seed is expanded into initial values for the 64-bit registers via concatenation and bitwise transformations:
   - `s1 = {48'd0, seed, seed}`
   - `s2 = {48'd0, seed, ~seed[3:0], seed[7:4]}`
   - `s3 = {48'd0, seed, seed ^ 8'hA5}`

2. **Encryption/Decryption (RUN)**  
   On every clock edge, for 8 cycles:
   - Registers are updated using fixed LFSR-like feedback:
     - `s1 <= {s1[62:0], s2[0] ^ s3[1] ^ s1[5] ^ s2[7] ^ s3[13] ^ s1[31] ^ s2[47] ^ s3[60]}`
     - `s2 <= {s2[62:0], s3[3] ^ s1[1] ^ s2[2] ^ s3[19] ^ s1[23]}`
     - `s3 <= {s3[62:0], s1[5] ^ s2[2] ^ s3[4] ^ s1[17] ^ s2[29] ^ s3[63] ^ s1[10] ^ s2[40]}`
   - A single keystream bit is generated per cycle as `s1[0] ^ s2[0] ^ s3[0]`.
   - After 8 bits, the `temp_keystream` is XORed with `ui_in` to yield `uo_out`.

3. **Reset Phase (RESET)**  
   If `uio_in == 0xFF`, internal state is reset to default constants and FSM returns to `IDLE`.

A single keystream bit is generated each cycle as `s1[0] ^ s2[0] ^ s3[0]` and shifted into an 8-bit buffer (`temp_keystream`). After eight cycles, `temp_keystream` is XOR-ed with `ui_in` to produce `uo_out`. A three-state FSM (`IDLE`, `RUN`, `RESET`) coordinates seeding, byte-wise code generation, and reset under an active-low `rst_n`.

## Internal State

- `s1`, `s2`, `s3` (64 bits each): linear-feedback shift registers  
- `temp_keystream` (8 bits): accumulates keystream bits  
- `step` (3 bits): counts cycles 0–7 per output byte  
- `state` (2 bits): FSM state (`IDLE = 0`, `RUN = 1`, `RESET = 2`)  

---

## Inputs

- `ui_in[7:0]`: data byte (plaintext or coded text)  
- `uio_in[7:0]`:  
  - `!= 0x00` & `!= 0xFF`: 8-bit seed to initialize `s1`, `s2`, `s3`  
  - `0x00`: normal operation (no reseed)  
  - `0xFF`: force reset  
- `clk`: system clock  
- `rst_n`: active-low asynchronous reset  
- `ena`: global enable (tied high)  

---

## Outputs

- `uo_out[7:0]`: coded and decoded byte  
- `uio_out[7:0]`, `uio_oe[7:0]`: unused (tied to zero)  

---

## Symmetry and Reuse

Due to the symmetric nature of the design, applying the same seed followed by the same encoded text reproduces the original plaintext.

## How to test

You can test this design either using a Verilog testbench or via a Cocotb Python-based test. See: [How to test](https://github.com/RVCE-ECE/TT10_TSC/tree/main/test/README.MD)

All inputs/outputs are internal to the digital logic and tested in simulation. The design is fully self-contained and does not require external PMODs, displays, or peripherals. 

---

## How to use

Modify the test.py to test the cipher by passing textfiles or images. Decode the files using same seed as used for ecncryption.
