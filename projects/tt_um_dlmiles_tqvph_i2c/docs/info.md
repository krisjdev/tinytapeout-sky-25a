The peripheral index is the number TinyQV will use to select your peripheral.  You will pick a free
slot when raising the pull request against the main TinyQV repository, and can fill this in then.  You
also need to set this value as the PERIPHERAL_NUM in your test script.

You can also include images in this folder and reference them in the markdown. Each image must be less than
512 kb in size, and the combined size of all images must be less than 1 MB.

TODO better UVM style register info

## How to test

Well....

Resolve the CMUX setting you need, maybe you need a NPN transistor and
external pull-up resistor (try 10k ohm, or 6k8 ohm but at least 1k ohm)
for each I2C bus line, SCL and SDA.
Maybe you can get away with direct wiring SCL (still with pull-up).
The RP2040 internal pull-up is probably too weak to use with faster I2C
but rates.

## TODO on next design iteration

Work through CPU register interface to optimize better.
Think through error indications to confirm the grouping makes sense.
Error timeout condition might be optional ?  Allowing CPU to manage and
FSM_RESET when needed.
Merge the FIFOs, try to have a single FIFO resource both sides can use and
reclaim the space as bigger FIFO.

I did not expect to have Clock Stretch feature on initial version, so
hopefully this works, but it has enable/disable that needs configuration.
