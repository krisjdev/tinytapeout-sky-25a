## How it works
Works at 2MHz using 50MHz clock as a sampling clock. However, it is programmable based on the inputs given

## How to test
Step the frequency 2MHz by 0.5MHz and measure the lock time. Also measure the jitter present in 2MHz output

## External hardware
Function generator, Oscilloscope, VCO
