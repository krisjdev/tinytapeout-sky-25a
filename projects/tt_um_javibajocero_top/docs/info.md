## How it works
This is just an UART + small WS2812b single led driver

Listens to ascii 'MARCO' and once detected, with 10us delay (mega fast) replies with '\n\rPOLO!\n\r' and blips the LED.

## How to test

Connect with with your favourite UART gizmo, i used my PC and FTDI FT2232HQ USB-UART bridge builtin my ArtyS7 evaluation board.

with default putty serial settings 9600 bauds 
8 data bits 
1 stop bit 
parity NONE 

and type uppercase 'MARCO' trough UART RX pin
you should receive a '\n\rPOLO!\n\r' on UART TX pin

More meta signals exposed in order to perform the testing are
- baud_tick_rx (9600*8 bauds) and baud_tick_tx (9600bauds) 
- trigger_send active for one clck cycle on 'MARCO' match, and uartTxbusy active during the '\n\rPOLO!\n\r' transmission

## External hardware

probably a USB to TTL dongle like CP2102
