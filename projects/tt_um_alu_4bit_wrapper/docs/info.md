## How it works

This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with flags, designed for integration in the Tiny Tapeout sky25a shuttle. The ALU performs arithmetic, logical, shift, and comparison operations on two 4-bit operands (A[3:0] and B[3:0]).

The design also generates status flags:
- Carry (unsigned overflow/borrow)
- Zero (result is zero)
- Negative (sign bit of result)
- Overflow (signed overflow)

This makes it suitable as a basic CPU building block or as a teaching/demo chip.

## How to test

1. Connect 8 toggle switches to ui_in[7:0] (for A and B).
2. Connect 4 toggle switches to uio_in[3:0] (for ALU_Sel).
3. Connect 8 LEDs (with resistors ~330 Î©) to uo_out[7:0].
    - LED
    - LEDs [7:4] = Flags (Carry, Zero, Neg, Ovf)
