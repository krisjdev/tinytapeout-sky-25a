## How it works

16 standard cell library flip-flops are wired to 16 custom half adder cells, to make a 16 bit counter.

## How to test

Provide a clock signal on clk.  in0 is the input to the LSB of the counter, so the counter will increment only if in0 is high.  The count is reset when rst_n is low.
