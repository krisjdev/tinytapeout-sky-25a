## How it works

This project implements a simple **MiniRISC processor** using an FSM-based control unit.  
- The design fetches an instruction (provided via the `ui_in` pins).  
- The FSM steps through the instruction cycle: **fetch → decode → execute → write-back**.  
- An **accumulator register (ACC)** stores intermediate results.  
- The output pins (`uo_out`) reflect the current ACC value or operation result.  
- Internal state is tracked via a finite state machine, ensuring each instruction executes deterministically across multiple clock cycles.  

The goal is to demonstrate how a minimal RISC-like processor can be built with simple Verilog, synthesized for Tiny Tapeout, and verified through simulation and hardware testing.

## How to test

1. **Simulation** (before fabrication):  
   - Use the provided `tb.v` testbench with Icarus Verilog and cocotb.  
     
2. **On real hardware**   
   - The packaged chip will be mounted on a Tiny Tapeout test PCB with a Raspberry Pi as the host.  
   - Reset the chip using the provided reset control.  
   - Send instructions sequentially via `ui_in` pins from the Raspberry Pi GPIO.  
   - Observe `uo_out` to capture results of operations.  
   - Compare against the expected outputs (the same instruction sequence used in simulation).  

This allows direct validation of the FSM processor on silicon, mirroring the cocotb verification flow.
