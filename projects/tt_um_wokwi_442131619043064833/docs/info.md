## How it works

A BCD to 7-segment encoder is a digital logic circuit that converts
a Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) input into signals that can drive a 7-segment display.
BCD represents decimal digits 0â€“9 in 4-bit binary:

Working Principle
The circuit maps each BCD input to the combination of segments that 
forms the corresponding decimal digit on the 7-segment display.
For example, to display 0, segments a, b, c, d, e, f are ON, and g is OFF.
AND EXTRA GATES INCLUDE CONTROL OF POINT 


## How to test

Outputs
7 segments of the display: a, b, c, d, e, f, g
Each output controls one segment. A high (1) signal lights up the segment, and low (0) turns it off.
Optional DP (decimal point) can also be controlled.

| Decimal | BCD (D3 D2 D1 D0) | a | b | c | d | e | f | g |
|---------|------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0       | 0000             | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1       | 0001             | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2       | 0010             | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 3       | 0011             | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 4       | 0100             | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 5       | 0101             | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 6       | 0110             | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 7       | 0111             | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 8       | 1000             | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 9       | 1001             | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

DP can be controled with 4,5 and 7 pins using gates AND, OR with 4, 5 inputs and 7 for select.



## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
this uses default hardware, leds and logic input.
