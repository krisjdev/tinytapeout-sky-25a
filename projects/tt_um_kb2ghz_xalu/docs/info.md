## How it works

The project is a 4-bit ALU section that is useful in mini and micro computer CPUs.

| Function    |F2  F1  F0 | Description |
| ------------|---------- | ------------ |
|ADD         |0   0   0 | add inputs A and B | 
|AND         |0   0   1 | bitwise and operation of ports A & B |
|OR          |0   1   0 | bitwise inclusive or of ports A & B |
|XOR         |0   1   1 | bitwise exclusive or of ports A & B |
|PASSA       |1   0   0 | pass input port A unmodified |
|PASSB       |1   0   1 | pass input port B unmodified |
|SHL         |1   1   0 | shift port A left one position |
|SHR         |1   1   1 | shift port A right one position |


## How to test

This device can be tested by inputting data on the two input ports (A/B), a function code (F0, F1, F2) and 
observing the output on pins d0, d1, d2, d3.

|Signal | Direction | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d0, d1, d2, d3 | output| function output |
| COM | input | assertion of this signal converts the output function to its 1's complement form |
| ZERO | output | this signal is asserted when the output function's value is +0 |
| NEG_ZERO | output | this signal is asserted when the output functions's value is -0 |
| ci_right | input | when performing SHL this signal shifted into position d0, when performing ADD this bit is added to output value |
| ci_left | input | when performing SHR this signal is moved into position d3, when ADDing ci_left is the input carry value |
| co_right| output | when performing SHR this signal will be equal to the unshifted value of d0 |
| co_left | output | when performing SHR this signal is equal to the unshifted value of d3, when ADDing co_left is the carry output from the addition operation |

## External hardware

This project was tested using an Intel/Altera FPGA (EP2C20F484C7).
