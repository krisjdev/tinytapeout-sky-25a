## How it works

The `tt_um_pwe` module is a **Pulse Width Encoder (PWE)** designed to generate a digital pulse of programmable width based on user-controlled input signals. This module receives a 4-bit width value along with control signals (`start` and `enable`) and responds by generating a `pulse_out` signal that remains high for the specified number of clock cycles. Upon completion, it raises a `done` flag for one clock cycle to indicate the end of the pulse generation sequence.

At the heart of the module is a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** that coordinates the pulse generation sequence across three well-defined states: `IDLE`, `COUNTING`, and `DONE`. This enables the design to operate predictably and synchronously, even when integrated into larger digital systems. The design is clock-driven and fully synchronous, with a global asynchronous active-low reset (`rst_n`) to initialize the internal states.

## Functional Description

### Input and Output Ports

#### Inputs

- `ui_in` (8 bits):
  - `ui_in[0]` - **start**: Initiates the pulse generation cycle when high.
  - `ui_in[1]` - **enable**: Must be high in conjunction with `start` to trigger the pulse.
  - `ui_in[5:2]` - **data_in**: 4-bit value specifying the pulse width (in clock cycles).
  - `ui_in[6]`, `ui_in[7]` - Unused; internally tied off to suppress lint warnings.

- `uio_in` (8 bits): General-purpose I/O input (not used in this design).
- `clk` - Clock signal for all sequential logic.
- `rst_n` - Active-low asynchronous reset.

#### Outputs

- `uo_out` (8 bits):
  - `uo_out[0]` - **pulse_out**: High during the pulse generation phase.
  - `uo_out[1]` - **done**: High for one cycle after the pulse completes.
  - `uo_out[7:2]` - Unused; set to zero.

- `uio_out`, `uio_oe` (8 bits each): Not used; tied to zero to act as high-impedance inputs.

## Internal Architecture

### Finite State Machine (FSM)

The FSM governs the behavior of the module with the following states:

1. **IDLE**:
   - Waits for `start` and `enable` signals.
   - When both are high, captures the value of `data_in` and stores it in the internal `counter`.
   - Transitions to the `COUNTING` state.

2. **COUNTING**:
   - Asserts `pulse_out` high.
   - Decrements `counter` on each clock cycle.
   - When `counter` reaches zero, transitions to the `DONE` state.

3. **DONE**:
   - Deasserts `pulse_out` and sets `done` high for a single clock cycle.
   - Transitions back to `IDLE`.

This sequencing ensures precise pulse generation, avoids glitches, and guarantees a clean `done` signal after pulse completion.

### Pulse Width Logic

- The value in `data_in` determines the number of clock cycles the `pulse_out` remains high.
- The `counter` register is initialized with `data_in` and decremented every cycle in the `COUNTING` state.
- Pulse generation is fully synchronous with the `clk` signal.

### Reset Behavior

- When `rst_n` is low:
  - The FSM resets to `IDLE`.
  - Registers like `counter`, `pulse_width`, `pulse_out`, and `done` are cleared to zero.
  - Ensures safe and deterministic startup.

### Unused Logic Handling

- All unused inputs (`uio_in`, `ui_in[6]`, `ui_in[7]`) are logically consumed using a bitwise AND expression to suppress unused signal warnings.
- All unused outputs (`uio_out`, `uio_oe`) are set to zero.

## How to Test

To validate the `tt_um_pwe` design, a testbench (`tt_um_pwe_tb.v`) is used to simulate various scenarios where different pulse widths are provided. The testbench monitors the outputs `pulse_out` and `done` and checks their timing against the expected behavior.

### Example Test Scenarios

| **Time (ns)** | **ui_in[5:2] (Pulse Width)** | **start** | **enable** | **Expected Behavior** |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| 0 – 10        | 0000 (0)                       | 0         | 0          | No operation           |
| 10 – 30       | 0100 (4)                       | 1         | 1          | 4-cycle pulse, then done |
| 30 – 60       | 0011 (3)                       | 1         | 1          | 3-cycle pulse, then done |
| 60 – 90       | 0001 (1)                       | 1         | 1          | 1-cycle pulse, then done |
| 90 – 100      | 0000                           | 0         | 0          | Remains in IDLE        |

During each simulation cycle:
- `pulse_out` should remain high for `data_in` number of clock cycles.
- `done` should pulse high for **exactly one cycle** after `pulse_out` deasserts.

## Monitoring Output

During simulation, real-time debugging and waveform inspection help verify that the FSM and counter logic work as intended.

Use the following `$monitor` statement in the testbench:

```verilog
initial begin
  $monitor("Time=%0t | start=%b enable=%b data_in=%b | pulse_out=%b done=%b", $time, ui_in[0], ui_in[1], ui_in[5:2], pulse_out, done);
end
```
