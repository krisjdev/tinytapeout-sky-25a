# Approximate computing based Leaky-Integrate-Fire Neuron Model

## How it works
This AFM-based LIF neuron model implementation features:
- 16-bit membrane potential
- Fully customizable parameters
- 8 pipline stages
- 8-bit current input
- 8 neurons in one structure

The equition of AFM based LIF neuron model is:
$$ 
V[t+1] = AFM\!\left(e^{-\frac{1}{\tau}}, V[t]-E_{rest}\right) + E_{rest} + I \\
\text{if } V[t] \leq V_{th}, \text{ then } V[t+1] = E_{rest}
$$

The execution of this architecture consists of three phases:
1. Parameter initialization  
2. Neuron initialization  
3. Normal operation  

## How to test

#### 1. Reset (Low to reset, rst_n = 0)

- All the parameter and membrane potential reset to 0.

#### 2. Parameter initialization  
1. **E_REST** requires two cycles of input.  
2. **e_tau** requires one cycle of input.
3. **v_th** requires two cycles of input.  

#### 3. Neuron initialization  
- The initial membrane potentials of 8 neurons are input in sequence.  
- After waiting for **2.5 clock cycles**, the initial currents are input sequentially.
- Each neuron requires **1 clock cycle** for initialization.

#### 4. Normal operation
- Input currents sequentially  
- Each neuron computation takes **1 clock cycle**  
- 8 neurons require **8 clock cycles** in tot

## External hardware
None required - all the operation of this design can be done through digital I/O
