## How it works

There are multiple digital designs provided. The first one at the top is a four bit counter, which counts up to 1111 and triggers an output. 
The second design includes a +ve and -ve edge trigger logic.
The third design is an LFSR for pseudo random number generator sequence.
The last design has multiple pulse counters and trigger circuit, considered as a reservoir.
## How to test

On-chip clock and external inputs could be connected and output ports are used to observe teh output.

## External hardware

None
